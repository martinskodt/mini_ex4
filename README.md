### Feedback and cybernetics
There is a loop between the red ball and the edges of the stage. every time the ball hits the edge the ball gets reset to a random center place in the stage. I did have the intention to make this game with more stages, where the red ball had multible patterns and the score resets but i sadly did not have the time. But there is feedback in form of the score system. in form og points gained from hitting the ball. In the spirit of cybernetics, In playing the game the mouse becomes a higly intergrated part with your movements.
